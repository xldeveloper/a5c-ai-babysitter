# Babysitter Start Run Command

Before anything else, use the Babysitter Skill. (read "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/babysitter/SKILL.md" - the babysitter/SKILL.md file)

Execute the setup script to initialize the Babysitter run:

```!
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-babysitter-run.sh" --claude-session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" $ARGUMENTS
```

## Architecture Overview

This command integrates with the **hook-driven orchestration system**:

1. **setup-babysitter-run.sh** initializes the loop state
2. **babysitter-stop-hook.sh** (on-stop hook) prevents exit and continues the loop
3. **run:iterate** CLI command drives each orchestration step (called by hooks)
4. **on-iteration-start hook** executes tasks (via native-orchestrator.sh)
5. Loop continues until completion promise or max iterations

## Key Principles

- **Hooks execute** - All task execution happens in hooks (not in skill)
- **CLI iterates** - run:iterate provides single iteration orchestration
- **Skill loops** - The babysitter skill provides the external loop via stop hook
- **Event-sourced** - All state changes recorded in journal.jsonl

## How It Works

When you work on the task and try to exit:
1. Stop hook intercepts the exit attempt
2. Hook checks completion conditions (promise, max iterations)
3. If not complete, hook feeds prompt back to continue
4. You'll see your previous work in journal, state.json, files, and git history
5. Continue iterating and improving until completion

CRITICAL RULE: If a completion promise is set, you may ONLY output it when the statement is completely and unequivocally TRUE. Do not output false promises to escape the run, even if you think you're stuck or should exit for other reasons. The run is designed to continue until genuine completion.
