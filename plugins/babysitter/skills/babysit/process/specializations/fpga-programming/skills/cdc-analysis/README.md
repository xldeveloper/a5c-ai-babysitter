# CDC Analysis Skill

Specialized skill for clock domain crossing analysis and synchronizer design in multi-clock FPGA designs.

## Purpose

This skill provides deep expertise in CDC methodology, enabling:
- Safe multi-clock domain designs
- Metastability prevention
- Proper synchronizer implementation
- CDC constraint development

## Key Features

- Clock domain crossing identification
- Synchronizer design (2FF, 3FF, handshake)
- Gray code FIFO implementation
- MTBF calculation
- CDC constraint generation
- Violation detection and resolution

## Integration

Used primarily with:
- CDC Design Process
- Reset Strategy Process
- Clock Network Design Process
- Timing Constraints Process
