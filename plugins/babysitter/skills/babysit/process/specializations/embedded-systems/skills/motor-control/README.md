# Motor Control Skill

Motor control algorithms and driver implementation.

## Purpose

Provides motor control development expertise:
- PWM generation and configuration
- FOC and control algorithms
- Position/speed feedback processing
- Current sensing and protection
- Control loop tuning

## Key Features

- Multi-motor type support (BLDC, PMSM, stepper)
- Field-Oriented Control (FOC)
- Encoder and Hall sensor interface
- Sensorless algorithms
- Current loop and speed loop design

## Integration

Used by processes requiring motor control:
- Device driver development
- Real-time architecture design
- ISR design and implementation

## Dependencies

- Motor control libraries
- DSP libraries for fixed-point math
- Encoder/Hall sensor hardware
