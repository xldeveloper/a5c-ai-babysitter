# Graph Modeler

A skill for converting problems into graph representations.

## Overview

This skill analyzes problem descriptions to identify graph structures, mapping entities to nodes and relationships to edges, then suggesting appropriate algorithms.

## Key Features

- Entity-to-node mapping
- Relationship-to-edge analysis
- Graph property detection
- Representation selection
- Algorithm suggestions

## Graph Properties Detected

- Directed vs Undirected
- Weighted vs Unweighted
- Bipartite structure
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- Tree structure
- Sparse vs Dense
