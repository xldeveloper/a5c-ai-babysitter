# Solution Comparator

A skill for comparing multiple algorithm solutions.

## Overview

This skill enables comparison of different solution implementations to verify correctness against a known-good solution and benchmark relative performance.

## Key Features

- Multi-solution correctness comparison
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing with random inputs
- Minimal counter-example finding
- Output diff analysis

## Use Cases

- Debugging a solution against a brute force oracle
- Comparing optimized vs naive implementations
- Finding edge cases that cause failures
- Validating algorithmic improvements
