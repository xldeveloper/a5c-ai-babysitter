## Implementation Notes

### Skill Implementation Guidelines
- Skills should be implemented as modular, reusable components that can be invoked by multiple agents
- Each skill should include clear input/output specifications and validation rules
- Skills should integrate with healthcare IT systems (EHR, HIE, RCM) via standard APIs and data formats
- Skills must maintain HIPAA compliance and audit logging for all PHI access

### Agent Implementation Guidelines
- Agents should orchestrate multiple skills to accomplish complex healthcare management tasks
- Each agent should have defined scope, authority levels, and escalation procedures
- Agents should support both autonomous operation and human-in-the-loop workflows
- Agents must implement appropriate clinical decision support safeguards for patient safety

### Integration Considerations
- All skills and agents should support HL7 FHIR for healthcare data exchange
- Revenue cycle skills should integrate with practice management and billing systems
- Quality and safety skills should integrate with event reporting and analytics platforms
- Compliance skills should maintain evidence documentation for regulatory audits
