## Implementation Notes

### Skill Implementation Guidelines
- Skills should be implemented as reusable modules that can be composed by multiple processes
- Each skill should include validation criteria for quality assessment
- Skills should support both synchronous invocation and asynchronous workflow integration
- Documentation should include example inputs/outputs and edge case handling

### Agent Implementation Guidelines
- Agents should be implemented with specialized system prompts reflecting domain expertise
- Each agent should have defined handoff protocols for multi-agent collaboration
- Agents should incorporate relevant disciplinary standards and ethical guidelines
- Quality gates should be configured based on process requirements and scholarly standards

### Priority Rationale
- **High Priority Skills**: Core methodological capabilities required for fundamental research processes
- **Medium Priority Skills**: Specialized capabilities for common but not universal workflows
- **Low Priority Skills**: Advanced or specialized capabilities for specific research contexts

### Cross-Specialization Integration
- SK-HUM-009 (Topic Modeling) integrates with Data Science specialization
- SK-HUM-011 (GIS Mapping) integrates with Geographic Information Systems capabilities
- SK-HUM-004 (TEI Encoding) integrates with Software Development for digital publishing
- AG-HUM-005 (Digital Humanities Technologist) bridges humanities and technical domains
