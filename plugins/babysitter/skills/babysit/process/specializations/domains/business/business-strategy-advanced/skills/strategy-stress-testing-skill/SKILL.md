# Strategy Stress Testing Skill

## Overview

The Strategy Stress Testing Skill provides comprehensive expertise in evaluating the robustness and resilience of strategic plans under various conditions and scenarios. This skill combines scenario planning, risk analysis, and strategic evaluation to identify vulnerabilities, test assumptions, and develop adaptation strategies. By systematically stress-testing strategies before implementation, organizations can build more resilient plans and prepare contingency responses for adverse conditions.

## Capabilities

### Strategy Vulnerability Assessment
- Identify critical assumptions underlying the strategy
- Map dependencies and single points of failure
- Assess concentration risks (customer, supplier, geographic, etc.)
- Evaluate competitive vulnerability points
- Analyze resource constraints and bottlenecks
- Identify regulatory and compliance risks
- Assess technology obsolescence risks
- Evaluate talent and capability gaps

### Scenario-Based Strategy Testing
- Test strategy performance across multiple scenarios
- Apply scenario axes to create alternative futures
- Evaluate strategy robustness vs. specific scenarios
- Identify scenarios where strategy fails or underperforms
- Calculate scenario-weighted expected outcomes
- Assess strategy flexibility and adaptability
- Compare alternative strategies across scenarios

### Assumption Stress Testing
- Document explicit and implicit strategic assumptions
- Categorize assumptions by uncertainty and impact
- Design tests to challenge critical assumptions
- Apply sensitivity analysis to key variables
- Conduct "what if" analysis on assumption changes
- Identify assumption clusters and interdependencies
- Develop assumption monitoring and validation plans

### Financial Stress Testing
- Model financial performance under stress scenarios
- Apply Monte Carlo simulation for probability distributions
- Conduct sensitivity analysis on key financial drivers
- Test covenant compliance under adverse conditions
- Assess liquidity and cash flow resilience
- Model break-even scenarios and margin of safety
- Evaluate capital structure resilience

### Competitive Response Modeling
- Anticipate competitor reactions to strategic moves
- Model competitive escalation scenarios
- Assess first-mover vs. fast-follower dynamics
- Evaluate price war and margin compression scenarios
- Test strategy against new entrant scenarios
- Model disruptive innovation threats
- Assess regulatory and antitrust scenarios

### Resilience Assessment Framework
- Evaluate strategic flexibility and optionality
- Assess adaptive capacity and learning capabilities
- Measure resource slack and buffer capacity
- Evaluate decision speed and response time
- Assess information systems and early warning capabilities
- Evaluate organizational agility and change readiness
- Measure stakeholder relationship strength

## Methodologies

### Pre-Mortem Analysis
- Imagine the strategy has failed spectacularly
- Work backward to identify causes of failure
- Categorize failure modes and probabilities
- Prioritize risks for mitigation
- Develop preventive actions

### Assumption-Based Planning (ABP)
- Identify load-bearing assumptions
- Classify assumptions by uncertainty
- Design signposts for assumption monitoring
- Develop shaping actions to influence assumptions
- Create hedging actions for uncertain assumptions

### War Gaming
- Simulate competitive dynamics and responses
- Role-play competitor, customer, and regulator perspectives
- Test strategic moves and countermoves
- Identify unexpected vulnerabilities
- Refine strategy based on gaming insights

### Reverse Stress Testing
- Start with a failure outcome (bankruptcy, market exit, etc.)
- Identify scenarios that would cause this outcome
- Assess probability and proximity of failure scenarios
- Develop early warning indicators
- Create prevention and contingency plans

### Robust Decision Making (RDM)
- Identify deep uncertainties in the environment
- Generate large ensembles of scenarios
- Test strategy across scenario space
- Identify vulnerabilities and scenarios of concern
- Develop adaptive strategies and triggers

## Stress Testing Dimensions

### External Environment Stresses
- Economic recession/depression scenarios
- Industry disruption scenarios
- Regulatory change scenarios
- Geopolitical crisis scenarios
- Technology shift scenarios
- Social/demographic change scenarios
- Environmental/climate scenarios

### Competitive Stresses
- New entrant scenarios
- Competitor consolidation scenarios
- Price war scenarios
- Technology leapfrog scenarios
- Business model disruption scenarios
- Talent poaching scenarios

### Internal Stresses
- Key person departure scenarios
- Operational failure scenarios
- Technology system failure scenarios
- Quality crisis scenarios
- Cultural breakdown scenarios
- Capital constraint scenarios

### Black Swan Events
- Pandemic scenarios
- Major cyber attack scenarios
- Natural disaster scenarios
- Terrorism/geopolitical crisis scenarios
- Financial system crisis scenarios
- Supply chain collapse scenarios

## Usage

### Input Requirements
- Strategic plan document
- Financial projections and models
- Assumption documentation
- Scenario descriptions
- Competitor intelligence
- Risk register
- Historical performance data

### Output Deliverables
- Vulnerability assessment report
- Scenario-strategy performance matrix
- Assumption sensitivity analysis
- Financial stress test results
- Competitive response analysis
- Resilience scorecard
- Adaptation recommendations
- Contingency plans

### Best Practices
1. Test early and iteratively, not just at the end
2. Challenge assumptions explicitly and rigorously
3. Include diverse perspectives in stress testing
4. Consider second-order effects and cascades
5. Test against plausible scenarios, not just likely ones
6. Document lessons and update strategies
7. Build stress testing into regular strategic reviews
8. Connect stress tests to contingency planning
9. Use quantitative and qualitative methods
10. Maintain intellectual honesty about vulnerabilities

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Confirmation bias**: Only testing scenarios where strategy succeeds
- **Scenario myopia**: Testing only one or two familiar scenarios
- **Assumption blindness**: Failing to surface implicit assumptions
- **Optimism bias**: Underestimating probability of adverse scenarios
- **Analysis paralysis**: Endless testing without action
- **Siloed testing**: Financial stress tests disconnected from strategic stress tests
- **One-and-done**: Treating stress testing as a single event, not ongoing process
- **Window dressing**: Conducting stress tests for show without real scrutiny

## Integration Points

- **Scenario Planning**: Stress testing uses scenarios developed in scenario planning
- **Risk Management**: Stress tests inform enterprise risk assessment
- **Strategic Planning**: Results feed back into strategy refinement
- **Financial Planning**: Stress tests validate financial projections
- **Business Continuity**: Stress tests inform BCP scenarios
- **Board Governance**: Stress test results support board oversight
