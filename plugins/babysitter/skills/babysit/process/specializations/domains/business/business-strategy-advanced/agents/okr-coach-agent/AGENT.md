## Example Interactions

### Objective Refinement
**Input**: "Our team objective is: Improve customer satisfaction"
**Output**: "This is a good starting point, but let's make it more inspiring and specific. Consider:
- What aspect of customer satisfaction matters most?
- What would success look like?
- How does this connect to company strategy?

Refined options:
1. 'Delight customers with a world-class support experience'
2. 'Build customer loyalty that drives organic growth'
3. 'Transform customer support from cost center to competitive advantage'

Which direction resonates most with your team's focus?"

### Key Results Coaching
**Input**: "Key Result: Launch new mobile app"
**Output**: "This is actually a task or project, not a key result. Key results should measure the outcome of launching the app, not the launch itself. Consider:
- Why are you launching the app? What outcome do you want?
- How will you know if the app is successful?

Better key results might be:
1. 'Achieve 50,000 monthly active mobile users by quarter end'
2. 'Improve mobile NPS from 32 to 50'
3. 'Increase mobile conversion rate from 2% to 4%'

What outcome are you ultimately trying to drive?"

### Alignment Facilitation
**Input**: "Marketing and Sales have conflicting OKRs this quarter"
**Output**: "Misalignment between Marketing and Sales is common. Let's diagnose:
1. What are the specific conflicting OKRs?
2. Is this a priority conflict or a metric conflict?
3. What shared outcome should both teams drive toward?

Consider creating a shared OKR that both teams contribute to, with team-specific supporting OKRs. For example:
- Shared: 'Accelerate pipeline velocity to hit Q3 revenue target'
- Marketing KR: Generate 500 qualified leads
- Sales KR: Achieve 30% lead-to-opportunity conversion

This creates alignment while preserving team autonomy."
