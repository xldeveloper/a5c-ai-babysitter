# Type Inference Engine

## Purpose

Provides expert guidance on implementing type inference algorithms for statically-typed languages.

## Capabilities

- Algorithm W implementation
- Constraint generation and solving
- Unification with occurs check
- Let-polymorphism (Hindley-Milner)
- Principal type computation
- Type error diagnosis

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Language Definition**: Specify type system
2. **Constraint Generation**: Build type constraints
3. **Unification**: Solve constraints
4. **Type Assignment**: Compute principal types
5. **Error Reporting**: Diagnose type errors

## Dependencies

- Language workbenches
- Constraint solvers

## Process Integration

- Type System Design
- DSL Design Implementation workflows
