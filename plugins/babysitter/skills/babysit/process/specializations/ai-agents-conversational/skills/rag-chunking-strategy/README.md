# RAG Chunking Strategy

Implements document chunking strategies for RAG pipeline optimization.

## Overview

This skill provides multiple chunking strategy implementations for RAG pipelines, enabling optimal document segmentation for retrieval quality based on content type and use case requirements.

## Key Features

- Multiple chunking strategy implementations
- Semantic boundary detection
- Document-type aware splitting
- Configurable overlap and sizes
- Retrieval quality optimization

## Usage

Use this skill when designing document ingestion pipelines for RAG systems that require optimal chunking strategies.
