## Implementation Recommendations

### High-Value Quick Wins

1. **Integrate MCP Servers**: Jira, Linear, Notion, and Productboard MCPs provide immediate value for existing workflows
2. **Adopt Existing Skills**: alirezarezvani/claude-skills Product Team package covers many core needs
3. **Leverage Mixpanel MCP**: Direct analytics integration eliminates manual data queries

### Gaps Requiring Custom Development

| Gap Area | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Feature Flags MCP | No existing LaunchDarkly/Split MCP integration | Medium |
| JTBD Analysis Tool | Limited dedicated JTBD frameworks | High |
| Cohort Analysis Skill | Mixpanel MCP partial; needs specialized skill | Medium |
| Beta Program Management | No integrated beta workflow tools | Low |

### Recommended Integration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Install core MCP servers (Jira, Notion, GitHub)
2. **Phase 2**: Adopt alirezarezvani/claude-skills Product Team package
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate Mixpanel MCP for analytics processes
4. **Phase 4**: Build custom skills for gaps (JTBD, Feature Flags)
