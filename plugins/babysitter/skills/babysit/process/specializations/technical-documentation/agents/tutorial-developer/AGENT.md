### 2. Step-by-Step Guide Creation

#### Writing Effective Steps

```yaml
step_guidelines:
  structure:
    - action_title: Start with verb
    - context: Why this step matters (1-2 sentences)
    - instructions: Numbered sub-steps
    - code: If applicable
    - verification: How to confirm success
    - troubleshooting: Common issues

  best_practices:
    - One action per step
    - Maximum 5-7 sub-steps
    - Show expected output
    - Include screenshots for UI
    - Provide copy-paste code
    - Note common mistakes

  anti_patterns:
    - Multiple unrelated actions
    - Assuming knowledge
    - Missing verification
    - Unexplained code
    - No error guidance
```

### 3. Code Walkthrough Development

#### Annotated Code Pattern

```javascript
// tutorial-code.js

// Step 1: Import the SDK
// The SDK provides all the methods we need to interact with the API
import { Client } from '@example/sdk';

// Step 2: Initialize the client
// We create a new client instance with our API key
// The API key should be stored securely (not hardcoded in production)
const client = new Client({
  apiKey: process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY, // (1)!
});

// Step 3: Create a user
// The create() method returns a Promise with the new user object
const user = await client.users.create({
  email: 'user@example.com', // (2)!
  name: 'Jane Doe',
});

// Step 4: Log the result
// The user object contains the ID assigned by the server
console.log(`Created user: ${user.id}`); // (3)!
```

```markdown
1. Always use environment variables for API keys
2. Email must be unique in the system
3. The ID is a UUID generated by the server
```

### 4. Interactive Code Environments

#### Playground Configuration

```yaml
# Interactive tutorial config
playground:
  type: codesandbox  # codesandbox, stackblitz, replit
  template: node

  files:
    - path: index.js
      content: |
        // Your code here
        const client = new Client({ apiKey: 'demo-key' });
      editable: true

    - path: package.json
      content: |
        {
          "dependencies": {
            "@example/sdk": "^1.0.0"
          }
        }
      editable: false

  environment:
    EXAMPLE_API_KEY: demo-key-for-tutorial

  instructions:
    - "Modify the code to add a user"
    - "Run the code to see the result"
    - "Check the console for output"

  validation:
    type: output
    expect: "Created user:"
```

### 5. Learning Progression Design

```

### 6. Assessment and Verification

#### Knowledge Checks

```yaml
knowledge_check:
  after_step: 3
  type: multiple_choice
  question: "What method creates a new user?"
  options:
    - "client.users.new()"
    - "client.users.create()"  # correct
    - "client.createUser()"
    - "new User()"
  explanation: |
    The `create()` method on the `users` resource creates a new user.
    All CRUD operations follow this pattern: `client.{resource}.{action}()`.

hands_on_check:
  type: code_execution
  prompt: "Create a user with email 'test@example.com'"
  starter_code: |
    const client = new Client({ apiKey: 'demo' });
    // Your code here
  validation:
    type: includes
    expect: "client.users.create"
  solution: |
    const client = new Client({ apiKey: 'demo' });
    const user = await client.users.create({
      email: 'test@example.com',
      name: 'Test User'
    });
```
