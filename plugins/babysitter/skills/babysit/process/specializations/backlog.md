For each specialization, ensure a directory under `specializations/[name]/` with the following structure:
```
specializations/
├── domains/
    ├── [domain-name-slugified]/
        ├── [specialization-name-slugified]/
                ├── references.md - research for reference materials for processes and methodologies for this specialization. Make sure to include links to the references.
                ├── README.md - roles and responsibilities for this specialization, goals and objectives, use cases, common flows, description of the specialization, and other relevant information.
```

## Phase 1: Research, Readme and References

At this phase, only research the specializations and their references for common practices, etc. Do not create the actual process.js files from the references yet. only create the README.md and references.md files. for each.

## Phase 2: Identifying Processes, methodologies, work patterns, flows, processes, etc.

Create a processes-backlog.md file in the directory. This file will contain the list of processes, methodologies, work patterns, flows, processes, etc. for this specialization. with bullet point (open todo, for each process identified - with a short description of the process, and a link to the reference if available)

## Phase 3: Create process javascript files for each process identified

for each process in the processes-backlog.md file, create a js file in the directory. according to the syntax, conventions and patterns of the Babysitter SDK and the rest of the existing processes.
