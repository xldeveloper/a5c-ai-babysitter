## 1. Shape Up

**Creator**: Basecamp (Ryan Singer)
**Year**: Modern (2019)
**Priority**: 🔥 High
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Product Development / Project Management

### Overview
Shape Up is Basecamp's methodology for building products through 6-week cycles with clear shaping, betting, and building phases. It emphasizes appetite-driven development, fixed time with variable scope, and small autonomous teams.

### Key Principles
- **Appetite not estimates**: Define how much time you want to spend, not how long it will take
- **Fixed time, variable scope**: 6-week cycles with cool-down periods
- **Shaping**: Abstract design work before committing resources
- **Betting Table**: Senior team decides what to build
- **Hill Charts**: Visual progress tracking (uphill = figuring out, downhill = executing)
- **Circuit Breaker**: If work isn't done in 6 weeks, it doesn't get extended automatically
- **No backlogs**: Work that doesn't get chosen gets discarded

### Implementation Plan

## 8. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Creator**: Eric Evans
**Year**: Established (2003), still highly relevant
**Priority**: 🔥 High
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Strategic Design / Tactical Design / Architecture

### Overview
Domain-Driven Design is an approach for building complex software systems that places the business domain at the center of development. It provides both strategic patterns for organizing large systems and tactical patterns for modeling domain logic.

- **Bounded Contexts**: Specific areas where a model/language is consistently used
- **Context Mapping**: Define relationships between bounded contexts
- **Subdomains**: Core (key differentiator), Supporting (necessary but not core), Generic (off-the-shelf)

**Tactical Design (Solution Space)**:
- **Entities**: Objects with unique identity (e.g., Customer, Order)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable values without identity (e.g., Money, Address)
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of entities/value objects treated as a unit
- **Repositories**: Abstract persistence of aggregates
- **Domain Services**: Operations that don't belong to entities

## 11. ATDD/TDD (Test-Driven Development)

**Creator**: Kent Beck (TDD), Brian Marick (ATDD concepts)
**Year**: Established practice (1999-present)
**Priority**: 🔥 High
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Testing / Development Process

### Overview
Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) are feedback-driven, test-first approaches. ATDD focuses on acceptance-level tests defined by customers before development, while TDD focuses on unit-level tests written by developers. They work together: ATDD provides high-level acceptance criteria that guide development, while TDD helps implement code at the unit level.

### Key Principles
**TDD (Unit Level)**:
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Refactor
- **Unit tests first**: Tests written before production code
- **Small iterations**: Tiny test-code cycles
- **Design emerges**: Tests drive better design

**ATDD (Acceptance Level)**:
- **Customer-defined criteria**: Business stakeholders define acceptance tests
- **Communication tool**: Bridge between customer, developer, and tester
- **Outside-in**: Start with acceptance tests, use TDD for implementation
- **Automated acceptance**: Tests become regression suite

## 12. Waterfall

**Creator**: Winston W. Royce (1970)
**Year**: Classic SDLC
**Priority**: 📋 Classic
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Sequential SDLC

### Overview
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Progress flows in one direction (like a waterfall) through phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

### Key Principles
- **Sequential phases**: No phase overlap
- **Document-driven**: Heavy documentation at each phase
- **Phase gates**: Formal approval before proceeding
- **Requirements fixed early**: All requirements defined upfront
- **No backtracking**: Expensive to return to previous phases
- **Well-suited for**: Stable requirements, regulatory environments, clear specifications

**Six Phases**:
1. **Requirements**: Gather and document all requirements
2. **Design**: Define system architecture and detailed design
3. **Implementation**: Write code per design specifications

**Priority**: 📋 Classic
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Risk-Driven Iterative

### Overview
The Spiral Model is a risk-driven software development process model created by Barry Boehm in 1986. Development progresses in a spiral shape through multiple loops, where each loop represents a complete development cycle with four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, and Evaluation. It's designed for large, complex projects (6 months to 2 years).

### Key Principles
- **Risk-driven**: Risk analysis performed each iteration
- **Iterative spirals**: Multiple loops through the four phases
- **Flexible process**: Can incorporate elements of waterfall, incremental, evolutionary prototyping

## 15. V-Model

**Creator**: Evolved from waterfall in the 1980s
**Year**: Classic verification/validation
**Priority**: 📋 Classic
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Verification & Validation / Testing

### Overview
The V-Model is an SDLC model where execution happens in a sequential V-shape. It's also known as the Verification and Validation model. The left side of the "V" represents decomposition of requirements and system specifications, while the right side represents integration and validation. Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.

### Key Principles
- **Verification and Validation**: "Are you building it right?" (verification) vs "Are you building the right thing?" (validation)
- **Testing parallel to development**: Testing phases planned alongside development phases
- **V-shape mapping**: Requirements → Unit Tests, Design → Integration Tests, Architecture → System Tests
- **Early test planning**: Test design starts during corresponding dev phase
- **High discipline**: Rigorous documentation and phase completion
- **Best for**: Safety-critical systems (aerospace, automotive, healthcare)

**V-Model Phases**:
**Left side (Development)**:
1. Requirements Analysis → Acceptance Testing
2. System Design → System Testing
3. Architectural Design → Integration Testing

## 19. Scrum

**Creator**: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland
**Year**: Dominant Agile framework (1995-present)
**Priority**: ⭐ Medium
**Implementation Status**: 📝 Not Implemented
**Category**: Agile Sprint-Based Framework

### Overview
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products through iterative progress via sprints (timeboxed iterations, typically 2 weeks). It defines roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment), and events (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective).

### Key Principles
- **Empiricism**: Decisions based on observation and experimentation

- **Inspection**: Regular inspection toward Sprint Goal
- **Adaptation**: Adjust process when inspection reveals unacceptable deviation
- **Fixed-length sprints**: No changes during sprint that endanger Sprint Goal
- **Cross-functional teams**: Team has all skills needed
- **Self-organizing teams**: Team chooses how to best accomplish work

**Three Roles**:
1. **Product Owner**: Maximizes product value, manages Product Backlog
2. **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum, removes impediments
3. **Development Team**: Delivers potentially releasable Increment

**Five Events**:
1. **Sprint**: Container for all events (1-4 weeks, commonly 2 weeks)
2. **Sprint Planning**: Plan work for sprint (max 8 hours for 1-month sprint)
3. **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute daily synchronization
4. **Sprint Review**: Inspect Increment, adapt Product Backlog
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: Plan improvements for next sprint
