| No special characters | `run-create.md` not `run:create.md` |
| Descriptive names | `configure-breakpoint-service.md` |
| Index files for sections | `index.md` |

### 8.2 Frontmatter Standards

Every documentation file must include:

```yaml
---

  - sarah-chen
  - james-park
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]             # Required

```

### 8.3 Content Quality Checklist

Before publishing any documentation page:

- [ ] **Frontmatter complete** with all required fields
- [ ] **Breadcrumbs verified** against hierarchy
- [ ] **Cross-references working** (all internal links tested)

- [ ] **Screenshots current** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Spelling and grammar** reviewed
- [ ] **Persona alignment** verified (content matches target personas)
- [ ] **Prerequisites accurate** and linked
- [ ] **Next steps included** for progression

### 8.4 URL Structure

| How-to | `/how-to/breakpoints/configure-service/` |
| Reference | `/reference/cli/run-create/` |
| Explanation | `/explanation/core-concepts/event-sourcing/` |

### 8.5 Search Optimization

#### Page Metadata

- Title: Include primary keyword, max 60 characters
- Description: Actionable summary, max 160 characters
- Headers: Use H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections

| Explanation | Single version, concepts rarely change |

Version callout format:
```markdown
> **Version Note:** This feature requires Babysitter v1.2.0 or later.
```

### 8.8 Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Link validation | Weekly (automated) | CI/CD |
| Code example testing | Per release | Release engineer |
| Screenshot updates | Per major release | Documentation team |
| Content review | Quarterly | Documentation team |
| Analytics review | Monthly | Documentation lead |
| User feedback review | Weekly | Documentation team |
