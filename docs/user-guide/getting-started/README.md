# Getting Started with Babysitter

**Welcome to Babysitter!** This guide will help you go from zero to running your first AI-orchestrated development workflow in just a few minutes.

## What is Babysitter?

Babysitter is an **orchestration framework** for Claude Code that transforms how you work with AI-assisted development. Instead of manually iterating with Claude until your code is "good enough," Babysitter automates the entire process with:

- **Automatic quality convergence** - Set a quality target (like 85%), and Babysitter iterates until it's achieved
- **Session persistence** - Close your laptop, come back tomorrow, and pick up exactly where you left off
- **Human-in-the-loop approval** - Add approval gates (breakpoints) for critical decisions before they execute
- **Complete audit trails** - Every decision, iteration, and change is recorded in an event journal

Think of Babysitter as a project manager for your AI coding sessions - it keeps track of progress, ensures quality standards are met, and never loses context.

### Why You Will Love Babysitter

| Without Babysitter | With Babysitter |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Claude, can you improve that?" (repeat 10x) | Set quality target once, iterate automatically |
| Lose all context when session ends | Resume from any point, even days later |
| Hope the AI made good decisions | Review and approve at key decision points |
| No record of what happened | Complete journal of every action |
| Run tasks one at a time | Parallel execution for faster results |

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. Quality Convergence
Stop manually asking Claude to "make it better." Define your quality target (test coverage, code standards, etc.) and Babysitter iterates until it's achieved.

```
# Example: Iterate until 85% quality score
claude "/babysit implement user auth with TDD, 85% quality target"
```

### 2. Never Lose Progress
Every action is recorded in an event-sourced journal. Session interrupted? No problem.

```
# Resume exactly where you left off
claude "Resume the babysitter run for the auth feature"
```

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Control
Add approval gates for critical decisions. Review context, approve or reject, and only then does execution continue.

```
# Babysitter will pause for approval before deploying
claude "/babysit deploy to production with breakpoint approval"
```

### 4. Structured Workflows
Choose from built-in methodologies (TDD, Spec-Kit, GSD) or create your own. Consistent, repeatable processes across your team.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Software

| Software | Version | How to Check | Installation Guide |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | 20.0.0+ (22.x recommended) | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** | 8.0.0+ | `npm --version` | Comes with Node.js |
| **Claude Code** | Latest | `claude --version` | [Claude Code Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |

### Recommended (for best experience)

| Software | Purpose | Installation |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **nvm** | Manage Node.js versions easily | [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) |
| **Git** | Version control for your projects | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **jq** | Parse JSON output from CLI | `brew install jq` (macOS) |

### Knowledge Prerequisites

| Level | What You Should Know |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Required** | Basic command line usage (cd, ls, npm) |
| **Required** | How to use Claude Code (basic prompting) |
| **Helpful** | JavaScript/TypeScript basics (for custom processes) |
| **Optional** | Test-driven development concepts |

### Verify Your Environment

Run these commands to confirm you're ready:

```bash
# Check Node.js (need 20.0.0+)
node --version
# Expected: v20.x.x or v22.x.x

# Check npm
npm --version
# Expected: 8.x.x or higher

# Check Claude Code
claude --version
# Expected: Claude Code version info
```

If any command fails, install the missing software before continuing.

## Installation Overview

Getting Babysitter running involves three steps:

1. **Install the SDK and packages** (npm global install)
2. **Install the Claude Code plugin** (via Claude's plugin system)
3. **Start the breakpoints service** (for human approval features)

**Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

Ready? Head to the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## How Babysitter Works (The Big Picture)

|  1. Research     |---> Analyze codebase
|  2. Plan         |---> Create specifications
|  3. Implement    |---> TDD iterations
|  4. Quality      |---> Score and improve
|  5. Approve      |---> Human checkpoint

Everything logged to .a5c/runs/<runId>/journal/
```

### The Magic: Event-Sourced Persistence

Every action Babysitter takes is recorded as an event in a journal:

```jsonl
{"type":"RUN_STARTED","runId":"01KFFTSF8TK8C9GT3YM9QYQ6WG","timestamp":"2026-01-25T10:30:00Z"}
{"type":"TASK_STARTED","taskId":"research-001","timestamp":"2026-01-25T10:30:01Z"}
{"type":"TASK_COMPLETED","taskId":"research-001","result":{...},"timestamp":"2026-01-25T10:30:45Z"}
```

This means:
- **Crash recovery:** Replay the journal to restore exact state
- **Audit trail:** Complete history of every decision
- **Debugging:** Trace exactly what happened and when
