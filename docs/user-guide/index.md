# Babysitter User Guide

Welcome to the Babysitter documentation. Babysitter is an AI-powered development workflow orchestrator that enables iterative quality convergence with human-in-the-loop approval through breakpoints.

## What is Babysitter? (Start Here if You're New)

**Babysitter automates the "try, check, fix, repeat" cycle of development** so you don't have to do it manually.

### The Problem Babysitter Solves

When you ask an AI to write code, you typically:
1. Get code from the AI
2. Run tests → tests fail
3. Send errors back to AI
4. Get fixed code
5. Run tests again → still failing
6. Repeat 5-10 times...

**Babysitter automates this entire loop**, running it until your quality targets are met.

### How It Works (In Plain English)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU: "Build a login page with tests"                           │
│                         ↓                                       │
│  BABYSITTER: Runs this loop automatically:                      │
│    1. AI writes code                                            │
│    2. Tests run → 60% pass                                      │
│    3. AI fixes failures                                         │
│    4. Tests run → 85% pass                                      │
│    5. AI fixes remaining issues                                 │
│    6. Tests run → 95% pass ✓ Target met!                       │
│                         ↓                                       │
│  YOU: Review and approve the final result                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Terms You'll See

| Term | What It Means | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Process** | A workflow definition | "Build feature with TDD" |
| **Run** | One execution of a process | Running the TDD workflow for your login page |
| **Task** | A single step in the process | "Write tests", "Run linter", "Check coverage" |
| **Quality Gate** | A check that must pass | Tests must be 90% passing |
| **Breakpoint** | A pause for human approval | "Review this code before I deploy it" (handled in chat or via web UI) |
| **Iteration** | One try-check-fix cycle | Attempt #3 to pass the tests |
| **Convergence** | Improving until target met | Going from 60% → 85% → 95% |

### Your First 5 Minutes

**What you'll do:**
1. Install Babysitter (1 command)
2. Run a simple workflow (1 command)
3. See it iterate until tests pass
4. Approve the result

**What you'll learn:**
- How the iteration loop works
- What a quality gate looks like
- How to approve at breakpoints

**What you'll see:**

```
/babysitter:call build a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide using TDD

Creating run: calculator-20260125-143012
Process: TDD Quality Convergence
Target: 90% quality

Iteration 1: Quality 65/100 - Tests: 6/10 passing
  → AI fixing test failures...

Iteration 2: Quality 82/100 - Tests: 9/10 passing
  → AI improving code coverage...

Iteration 3: Quality 95/100 - Target met! ✅

Claude: The implementation is complete. Quality score: 95/100.
        Do you approve the final result?
        [Approve] [Request Changes]

You: [Approve]

Done! Your calculator module is ready.
```

**Note:** Breakpoints (approval prompts) are handled directly in the chat when using Claude Code. No external service needed!

**The main command:** `/babysitter:call <your request>` handles everything automatically.
