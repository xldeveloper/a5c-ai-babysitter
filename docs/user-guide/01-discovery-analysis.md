## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 What is Babysitter?

Babysitter is an **event-sourced orchestration framework** for Claude Code that enables deterministic, resumable, and human-in-the-loop workflow management. It transforms how developers interact with AI-assisted coding by providing:

- **Structured multi-step workflows** with built-in quality gates
- **Human approval checkpoints** (breakpoints) for critical decisions
- **Iterative quality convergence** until targets are met
- **Complete audit trails** via append-only event journals
- **Session persistence and resumability** across interruptions

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition

| Traditional AI Coding | With Babysitter |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Run once, hope it works | Iterate until quality target met |
| Manual approval via chat | Structured breakpoints with context |
| State lost on session end | Event-sourced, fully resumable |
| Single task execution | Parallel execution with dependencies |
| No audit trail | Complete journal of all events |
| Ad-hoc workflows | Process-driven, customizable methodologies |

### 1.3 Key Components

1. **Babysitter SDK** (`@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk`) - Core orchestration runtime and CLI
2. **Babysitter Plugin** (`babysitter@a5c.ai`) - Claude Code integration
3. **Breakpoints Service** (`@a5c-ai/babysitter-breakpoints`) - Human approval UI and API
4. **Process Library** - Built-in methodologies (TDD, Spec-Kit, GSD, etc.)

### 1.4 Architecture Summary

```
User Request --> Claude Code --> Babysitter Skill --> SDK CLI

## 5. Quick Win Scenarios

### 5.1 First Quick Win: Simple TDD Feature (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Build a small feature using TDD methodology with quality gates.

**Command:**
```bash
claude "/babysit implement a simple calculator module with TDD and 80% quality target"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Babysitter creates a run with TDD quality convergence
2. Research phase analyzes codebase
3. Writes tests first, then implementation
4. Iterates until 80% quality score achieved
5. Requests approval via breakpoint before completion

**Success Criteria:**
- Working calculator module created
- Tests passing
- Quality score >= 80%
- Full event history in `.a5c/runs/`

### 5.2 Second Quick Win: Resume Interrupted Work (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate session persistence by resuming a paused run.

**Steps:**
1. Start a run: `claude "/babysit build a todo API --max-iterations 10"`
2. Close Claude Code mid-execution
3. Reopen Claude Code
4. Resume: `claude "Resume the babysitter run and continue"`

**Success Criteria:**
- Run continues from exact point of interruption
- No work is lost
- Journal shows complete history

### 5.3 Third Quick Win: Human Approval Workflow (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Experience the human-in-the-loop breakpoint system.

**Setup:** Ensure breakpoints service is running at `http://localhost:3184`

**Command:**
```bash
claude "/babysit refactor the auth module with breakpoint approval before changes"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Babysitter creates refactoring plan
2. Breakpoint triggers for human approval
3. Open `http://localhost:3184` to review and approve
4. Refactoring proceeds after approval

**Success Criteria:**
- Breakpoint appears in web UI
- Can review context files
- Approval releases the workflow
- Changes applied after approval

### 5.4 Quick Win Difficulty Progression

## 8. Common Issues and Pain Points

### 8.1 Installation Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| CLI not found after install | Global npm path not in PATH | Add npm global bin to PATH, or use `npx` |
| Plugin not appearing in Claude Code | Plugin not enabled | Run `claude plugin enable --scope user babysitter@a5c.ai` |
| Version mismatch errors | Mixed versions of packages | Update all packages to latest |
| Permission denied on hooks | Hook files not executable | Run `chmod +x` on hook files |

### 8.2 Runtime Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Breakpoint not resolving | Breakpoints service not running | Start with `npx @a5c-ai/babysitter-breakpoints@latest start` |
| Session ended unexpectedly | Network issue, Claude Code crash | Resume with `/babysit resume --run-id <id>` |
| Quality score not improving | Unrealistic target or blocking issues | Lower target, review iteration logs |
| Agent task timeout | Large context, API issues | Reduce task scope, check API status |
| Journal conflict | Concurrent operations | Avoid multiple instances, use resume to recover |

### 8.3 Conceptual Pain Points

| Pain Point | User Confusion | Resolution Strategy |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Event sourcing mental model | "Why is there a journal?" | Explain benefits: audit trail, resumability, debugging |
| Breakpoint workflow | "How do I approve things?" | Step-by-step breakpoint tutorial with screenshots |
| Process definitions | "How do I customize workflows?" | Templates, examples, progressive complexity |
| Quality scoring | "What determines the score?" | Document scoring criteria, show how to customize |
| In-session loop vs run orchestration | "What's the difference?" | Clear comparison table, use case guidance |

### 8.4 Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Meaning | Solution |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| `Run encountered an error` | Journal or state corruption | Analyze journal, recover from last good state |
| `Breakpoint not resolving` | Service unreachable or timeout | Check service status, verify network |
| `ENOENT: no such file or directory` | Missing file in task | Verify paths, check dependencies installed |

### 8.5 Performance Pain Points

| Issue | Symptom | Optimization |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Slow iterations | Each iteration takes minutes | Use parallel execution, reduce agent task scope |
| Large journal files | Disk usage grows quickly | Clean old runs, archive completed work |
| Memory issues | Out of memory errors | Limit concurrent tasks, increase Node.js heap |
| Runaway loops | Iterations don't converge | Set iteration limits, review quality criteria |
