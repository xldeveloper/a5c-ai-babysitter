## A

### Agent

A **task type** representing LLM-powered operations within a process. Agents perform intelligent tasks like planning, scoring, code review, and analysis.

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  kind: 'agent',
  agent: {
    name: 'quality-scorer',
    prompt: { role: 'QA engineer', task: 'Score results 0-100' }
  }
}
```

**Related:** [Task](#task), [Skill](#skill), [Effect](#effect)

**See Also:** [Process Definitions](../features/process-definitions.md)

---

### Agent Task

A task definition that invokes an LLM agent to perform intelligent operations. Agent tasks specify the agent name, prompt configuration, and expected output schema.

**Example:**
```javascript
const agentTask = defineTask('scorer', (args, ctx) => ({
  kind: 'agent',
  title: 'Score quality',
  agent: {
    name: 'quality-scorer',
    prompt: {
      role: 'QA engineer',
      task: 'Score the implementation',
      outputFormat: 'JSON'
    },
    outputSchema: { type: 'object', required: ['score'] }
  }
}));
```

**Related:** [Agent](#agent), [Task Definition](#task-definition)

---

### Approval Gate

See [Breakpoint](#breakpoint).

---

### Artifact

Any file produced during a run, stored in the `artifacts/` directory. Common artifacts include plans, specifications, reports, and generated documentation.

**Location:** `.a5c/runs/<runId>/artifacts/`

**Examples:**
- `process.md` - Process description
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan

## B

### Babysitter

The orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables deterministic, event-sourced workflow management. Babysitter provides structured multi-step workflows with quality gates, human approval checkpoints, and session persistence.

**Components:**
- SDK (`@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk`) - Core runtime and CLI
- Plugin (`babysitter@a5c.ai`) - Claude Code integration
- Breakpoints (`@a5c-ai/babysitter-breakpoints`) - Human approval system

**Related:** [SDK](#sdk), [Plugin](#plugin), [Breakpoints Service](#breakpoints-service)

---

### Babysitter Skill

The primary Claude Code skill for orchestrating runs. The skill manages the orchestration loop, executing iterations until completion.

**Location:** `plugins/babysitter/skills/babysit/SKILL.md`

**Invocation:**
```bash
/babysitter:babysit Build a REST API with TDD
```

**Related:** [Skill](#skill), [In-Session Loop](#in-session-loop)

---

### Breakpoint

A pause point in a process that requires human approval before continuing. Breakpoints enable human-in-the-loop workflows for critical decisions like deployment approval, plan review, or security-sensitive changes.

**Example:**
```javascript
await ctx.breakpoint({
  question: 'Approve the deployment?',
  title: 'Production Deployment',
  context: {
    files: [{ path: 'artifacts/plan.md', format: 'markdown' }]
  }
});
```

**Related:** [Breakpoints Service](#breakpoints-service), [Human-in-the-Loop](#human-in-the-loop)

**See Also:** [Breakpoints Feature](../features/breakpoints.md)

---

### Breakpoints Service

The external service providing human approval UI and API. Consists of a web UI (port 3184), REST API (port 3185), and worker for job processing.

**Package:** `@a5c-ai/babysitter-breakpoints`

**Start Command:**
```bash
npx -y @a5c-ai/babysitter-breakpoints@latest start
```

**Ports:**
- `3184` - Web UI

**Binary Names:** `babysitter`, `babysitter-sdk`

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g @a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk
```

**Related:** [SDK](#sdk)

**See Also:** [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md)

---

### Completion Promise

A special XML tag that signals the end of an in-session loop. When Claude outputs `<promise>TEXT</promise>` where TEXT matches the completion secret, the loop exits.

**Format:** `<promise>COMPLETION_SECRET</promise>`

**Usage:** Only output when the run status is `completed`.

**Related:** [In-Session Loop](#in-session-loop), [Completion Secret](#completion-secret)

---

### Completion Secret

A unique string emitted by `run:iterate` and `run:status` when a run completes successfully. Used with the completion promise to exit the in-session loop.

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "completionSecret": "run-abc123-completed-xyz789"
}
```

**Related:** [Completion Promise](#completion-promise)

---

### Context API

The interface available to process functions for interacting with the orchestration system. Provides methods for executing tasks, creating breakpoints, parallel execution, and state management.

**Methods:**

- `ctx.breakpoint(payload)` - Request human approval
- `ctx.sleepUntil(timestamp)` - Time gate
- `ctx.parallel.all(tasks)` - Parallel execution
- `ctx.hook(name, payload)` - Call custom hooks
- `ctx.log(message)` - Log to journal

- Reliable session resumption
- Audit trail verification

**Related:** [Event Sourcing](#event-sourcing), [Journal](#journal)

---

## E

- `agent` - LLM agent invocation
- `skill` - Claude Code skill invocation
- `breakpoint` - Human approval gate
- `sleep` - Time-based wait
