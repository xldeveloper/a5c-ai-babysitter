# Process Library

The Babysitter Process Library is a comprehensive collection of **2,000+ pre-built process definitions** (and growing) that you can use immediately or customize for your specific needs. This extensive library covers software development, business operations, scientific research, and dozens of specialized domains.

---

## In Plain English

> **Think of the Process Library like a cookbook with 2,000+ recipes.**
>
> Just like how a cookbook has recipes for Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and French cuisine - the Process Library has "recipes" for building web apps, mobile apps, APIs, security audits, and much more.
>
> **You don't need to read the whole cookbook.** Just tell Babysitter what you want to make:
> - "Build me a REST API" → Babysitter picks the right recipe automatically
> - "Use the TDD methodology" → You pick a specific recipe
>
> Each recipe includes:
> - **Ingredients** (inputs you provide)
> - **Steps** (phases of work)
> - **Quality checks** (tests to ensure it's done right)
> - **Approval points** (places where you review before continuing)

---

## Quick Start: Using the Library

**Most users never need to browse the library directly.** Just describe what you want:

```
/babysit build a user authentication system with login, registration, and password reset
```

Babysitter automatically finds and combines the right processes. Want a specific methodology?

```
/babysit with TDD methodology, create a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it! See the sections below for details on what's available.

---

## What is the Process Library?

The Process Library provides ready-to-use orchestration workflows for virtually any task you might encounter. Each process is:

- **Battle-tested**: Designed with best practices and quality gates built-in
- **Composable**: Can be combined with other processes to create complex workflows
- **Customizable**: Extend or modify any process to match your requirements
- **Self-documenting**: Includes clear inputs, outputs, and execution flow

Instead of writing orchestration logic from scratch, you can leverage these pre-built processes and focus on what matters: your actual work.

## How Babysitter Uses the Process Library

When you describe a task to Babysitter, the agent **automatically selects the most relevant processes** from the library and adapts them to your specific needs. This happens in several ways:

### Automatic Process Selection

Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:

```
Use babysitter to build a Next.js app with authentication and PostgreSQL
```

Babysitter will:
1. Identify relevant processes (e.g., `nextjs-fullstack-app`, `jwt-authentication`, `database-setup`)
2. Combine and adapt them to your requirements
3. Execute the orchestrated workflow with quality gates

### Explicit Process Selection

You can also request a specific process by name:

```
Use babysitter with the tdd-quality-convergence process to implement user authentication
```

Or:

```
Use babysitter with the devin methodology to build a REST API
```

### Mix and Match

For complex tasks, Babysitter intelligently combines multiple processes:

```
Use babysitter to create a microservices architecture with:
- GraphQL gateway
- Kubernetes deployment
- Monitoring and alerting
```

This might pull from `graphql-api-apollo`, `kubernetes-setup`, `monitoring-setup`, and `cicd-pipeline-setup` processes, adapting each to work together coherently.

### Customizing for Your Use Case

You can also modify existing processes or provide additional context:

```
Use babysitter with the security-audit process but focus specifically on
OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and include PCI-DSS compliance checks
```

The agent will take the base process and adapt it to your specific requirements.

## Browsing and Discovering Processes

### Asking Claude

The easiest way to discover processes is to ask Claude:

```
What processes are available for web development?
```

```
Show me security-related processes in the babysitter library
```

Claude can browse the process library and recommend the best match for your needs.

### Process Naming Convention

Process files follow a consistent naming pattern:

- `feature-name.js` - The process definition
- `README.md` - Category documentation
- `examples/` - Example inputs and usage
- `agents/` - Specialized agents for the category

### Finding the Right Process

1. **Start with the category** that matches your domain
2. **Review the README.md** in that category for an overview
3. **Check the JSDoc** at the top of each `.js` file for inputs/outputs
4. **Look at examples/** for sample usage patterns

## Using a Pre-Built Process

**Recommended: Just use `/babysit`** - it selects the right process automatically:

```
/babysit build a Next.js app with authentication, PostgreSQL database, and Vercel deployment
```

Babysitter will find the `nextjs-fullstack-app` process and configure it based on your request.

### Handle Breakpoints

The process will pause at breakpoints for human review. When a breakpoint triggers:

1. Open **http://localhost:3184** in your browser
2. Review the context files and question
3. Click **Approve** to continue or **Reject** to halt

See [Breakpoints](./breakpoints.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the breakpoints service.

## Customizing Processes

### Extending an Existing Process

```javascript
import { process as baseProcess } from './nextjs-fullstack-app.js';

export async function process(inputs, ctx) {
  // Add pre-processing
  const enhancedInputs = {
    ...inputs,
    additionalChecks: true,
    customConfig: myConfig
  };

  // Run base process
  const result = await baseProcess(enhancedInputs, ctx);

  // Add post-processing
  await ctx.task(myCustomValidation, result);

  return {
    ...result,
    customData: myCustomData
  };
}
```

### Composing Multiple Processes

```javascript
import { process as planPhase } from './gsd/plan-phase.js';
import { process as executePhase } from './gsd/execute-phase.js';
import { process as tddConvergence } from './tdd-quality-convergence.js';

export async function process(inputs, ctx) {
  // Planning with GSD
  const plan = await planPhase(inputs, ctx);

  // Execute with TDD quality gates
  const implementation = await tddConvergence({
    ...inputs,
    plan: plan.tasks,
    targetQuality: 90
  }, ctx);

  // Verify with GSD
  const verification = await executePhase({
    ...inputs,
    tasks: implementation.artifacts
  }, ctx);

  return { plan, implementation, verification };
}
```

### Modifying Process Parameters

Most processes accept configuration through inputs:

```json
{
  "feature": "User authentication",
  "targetQuality": 95,
  "maxIterations": 10,
  "requirements": [
    "Support OAuth2",
    "Include MFA"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use existing user table",
    "No breaking API changes"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Process

1. **Match your domain**: Start with the specialization that matches your work
2. **Check the methodology**: Consider which methodology fits your project style
3. **Review inputs carefully**: Understand what configuration options are available
4. **Read the examples**: Look at example inputs in the `examples/` directories

### Customization Tips

1. **Start simple**: Use processes as-is before customizing
2. **Layer changes**: Extend rather than modify base processes
3. **Preserve breakpoints**: Keep human approval gates in critical paths
4. **Test incrementally**: Validate customizations with small inputs first

### Quality Considerations

1. **Use quality convergence**: Processes with quality scoring help ensure high standards
2. **Enable breakpoints**: Human review catches issues early
3. **Compose methodologies**: Combine TDD with your domain process for better results
4. **Track iterations**: Monitor how many iterations processes require
