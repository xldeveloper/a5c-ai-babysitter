## Your First Babysitter Run

**Time:** 15 minutes | **Level:** Beginner | **Prerequisites:** Installation complete

### What We're Building

A simple calculator module. Don't worry - Babysitter will write the code for you!

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal

Open your terminal application. On Mac, you can find it in Applications > Utilities.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd ~/my-project
```

**What you should see:** Your terminal prompt should now show your project folder name.

### Step 3: Start Babysitter

Type this command exactly as shown:

```bash
claude "/babysit create a calculator module with add and subtract functions"
```

**What you should see:**

```
[babysitter] Creating run: run-20260125-143012
[babysitter] Process: tdd-quality-convergence
[babysitter] Starting iteration 1...
```

### Congratulations!

You just ran your first Babysitter workflow! Here's what happened:

1. **Babysitter created a "run"** - think of this as a work session
2. **It analyzed your request** - understanding you want a calculator
3. **It started iterating** - writing and improving code automatically

### What's Next?

- Want to see what was created? Check the `.a5c/runs/` folder
- Ready for more? Try the [Session Resumption Tutorial](./tutorial-resume.md)
- Confused about something? Check our [Glossary](./glossary.md)

### Stuck? Common First-Run Issues

| What You See | What It Means | What To Do |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| "command not found: claude" | Claude Code isn't installed | [Install Claude Code first](./prerequisites.md) |
| "Plugin not found" | Babysitter plugin missing | [Re-run plugin installation](./installation.md#plugin) |
| Nothing happens | Claude Code might be thinking | Wait 30 seconds, check if cursor is blinking |
